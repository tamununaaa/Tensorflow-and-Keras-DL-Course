# MACHINE LEARNING
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to learn and gradually improve its accuracy without the need to be explicitly programmed. Machine Learning is used in a number of fields like Fraud Detection, Credit Scoring, Customer Churn, Email Spam Filtering, Text Sentiment Analysis, Recommendation Engines, etc.


# NEURAL NETWORKS
Neural Networks are a way of modeling biological neuron systems mathematically. These networks are used to solve tasks that cannot be performed using other algorithms.

# DEEP LEARNING
 Deep Learning refers to neural networks with more than one hidden layer. These networks learn by discovering intricate structures in the data they experience.
